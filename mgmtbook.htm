		All I Really Need to Know in Business I Learned at Microsoft <br>
		Inside Strategies to Help You Succeed<br>

		While our book describes Microsoft from the top down, concentrating on the corporate culture and upper level management, this book comes at
		the same issue from the bottom up. Basically it's a how-to guide for employees and lower-level management. The combination of the two books
		gives you a complete picture of Microsoft from top to bottom.<br>
		If you are just starting in the business world and you want to know how to do your job well - treat this book as your bible. While I don't
		agree with everything in it, I would happily hire an employee who follows it religiously.

		This book does an excellent job of providing <b>documented</b> examples of fundamental do's and dont's for managing software development teams.
		It is a fast concise guide to what works and what doesn't work. However, I've found that even with the documented studies it uses, many managers
		are still unwilling to change stupid practices. So this book also proves there is no magic bullet for stupidity.<br>
		This book discusses the fundamentals, not the specifics of software development. Chapters

		Ok, you want the step-by-step details on how to manage a software project. This is it. The architecture, the design, the coding, and the
		testing. And interspersed, the details on the development environment, the scheduling, the status, and more. And the system he describes is
		the system used by numerous successful software teams. You don't need to follow it exactly, but you should have a good reason when you stray
		from what he describes.
