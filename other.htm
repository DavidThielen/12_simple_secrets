		David Thielen has written two technical books. The VxD book is getting a little dated as it was written specifically for Windows 95.
		However, the <b>No Bugs!</b> book is still relevant today and addresses what is still a major issue - how to write programs with
		fewer bugs.

		<FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
		Here are other management books we recommend. This is not an exhaustive list. But it is an excellent begining for people trying to improve
		the productivity at their office. Particularly for software teams. That said, while what needs to be done to be successful is easy, getting
		management to change is near impossible.
