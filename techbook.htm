		Every week the computer industry press is filled with stories of
		bug-ridden software releases that threaten to ruin a software company's
		reputation. No Bugs! offers a revolutionary approach to solving this
		problem by showing programmers how to write error-free code from
		the start.<p>

		Experienced software developer David Thielen reveals a series of
		tricks that you can include in a program to warn of the presence of
		bugs. All are designed to be quick and easy to implement so that you
		can shorten the amount of time needed to complete and test your
		programs. All coding is done in C, C++, and assembly language, and
		all examples are fully functional.<p>

		No Bugs! also explores effective testing strategies, demonstrating the
		importance of a carefully thought out testing process in shipping
		bug-free software.<p>

		More than a debugging guide No Bugs! offers programmers a new
		way of thinking about developing software. It is also an invaluable
		resource for testers, managers, software support personnel, and anyone
		involved in ensuring that software is delivered bug free to the customer.<p>

		Writing Windows Virtual Device Drivers<br>

		Virtual device drivers (also known as VxDs) allow Windows
		developers to access undreamed of power in their programs. If you
		want to write programs that have direct access to hardware devices,
		can interface to vital CPU functions, or can take over parts of the
		operating system, then welcome to the world of VxDs.<p>

		Written by experts in the field, David Thielen and Bryan Woodruff,
		Writing Windows Virtual Device Drivers introduces the concepts
		of virtual device drivers and shows how to write VxDs in both C and
		assembly language. Fully-commented complete working source code
		examples demonstrate how to write a VxD to talk to any hardware
		device and show the wealth of tricks you can perform with VxDs,
		including interprocess communication.<p>

		An extensive appendix provides an encyclopedic reference for the
		Virtual Machine Manager, the preemptive multitasking kernel at the
		heart of Windows, and system VxD services and macros.<p>
